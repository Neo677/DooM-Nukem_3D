# Sprite
Also i sort a considerable number of sprite for the animation such as
  - a LOT of weapon + reaload (no projectile)
  - caracter+ death
  - UI not all of it
  - hand of caracter (2 version armor)
  

# TODO / FOLLOW List
  For now we got a good game engine, with sky / ground / polygons and collisions 
                                                                    (collisions not optimal)
  we can go on : 
    - handle mouse / keyboard
    - save / loading
    - fly or swim
    - systeme object
